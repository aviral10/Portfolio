# Discord styled Portfolio Website

The website's UI design draws inspiration from popular platforms like Discord and Slack.

## Project highlights:
- Created a **config driven UI**, so to _add, update, delete_ any content on the site, I just need to make changes in the config file. No code changes are required hence saving any deployment cycles.
- Used some famous design-patterns to tackle small challenges when separating the UI and data layer.
- Built a very simple **In-memory-caching** solution to optimize fetching images.
- Zero if-else statements in the codebase(I dont know it that counts ðŸ˜‚).
- Implemented **AdobeAnalytics** and **GoogleAnalytics** to gain insights on how people are viewing my website. 
- The config is hosted on other remote repository, entire UI is modeled based on that.
- Implemented a backup config fallback mechanism in case fetching the remote config fails for some reason.
- Designed specific parsers for parsing the message content on the website. [Will update message content format later].
